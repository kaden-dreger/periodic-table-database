Makefile (server) Targets:
  * make (server)     : builds the project and generates the server executable
  * make serialport.o : compiles serialport.cpp into its respective object (.o) file
  * make server.o     : compiles server.cpp into its respective object (.o) file
  * make clean        : removes the .o and executable files from the directory
  * make help         : prints out information about the targets of the make file

Running Instructions:
    In order to correctly run the program, navigate to the correct directory in terminal with the source files. 
    Client:
      Proceed to the client directory, and use the command 'make upload' to upload the program to the Arduino. 
    Server:
      Then, proceed to the server directory and use the command 'make' to build the project. Then use the command './server' in order to run the server executable, and allow the server to come online.

How to use:
    Once the program is uploaded to the Arduino and the server is brought online, the following user actions are permitted:
    Client:
      Press either button to go to either the next or previous element,
      Tap the element card to see the back of it. Press again to see the front.
      Press the top right button to change the layout (3 in total) each layout has a different amount of information.
      Press the search button and go to the terminal.
    Server:
      If the search button is pressed on the client, go to the terminal and enter the element's name or a partial spelling of it and press enter. This will print the matches on the terminal screen and send the top 4 to the client. Once sent to the client press the one you want to go to. If less than 4 but more than 1 matches are found then blank boxes will appear on the client screen. Pressing the empty boxes will bring the user back to the current element. If only one match is found the program will go straight to that element. If no element is found the user will return to the current element.


Notes and Assumptions:
    This program assumes that the user will follow the exact input guidelines as shown above. The user must also strictly follow the running instructions stated above. In this case where the server is running before the program is uploaded to the Arduino, the compiler process will timeout. Also, the user must not access serial-mon at any time as it affects the data transfer between the client and server programs.

Modified Code:
  server.cpp:
    * method for reading in files in the 'readFile' function found from the site: cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/
  client.cpp:
  serialport.cpp/.h:
    * These files are from class used in assignment 2.
